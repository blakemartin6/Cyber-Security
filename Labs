# 🛠️ Projects

Welcome to the **Projects** directory of my cybersecurity lab! This section houses all hands-on labs, simulations, and exploratory builds I've worked on to deepen my understanding of networks, security protocols, operating systems, and more.

Each project folder contains:
- A **project overview** (`README.md` or `setup-guide.md`)
- **Configuration files** and **scripts** used
- Any **troubleshooting logs** or **notes**
- Optional: Screenshots or diagrams for documentation
